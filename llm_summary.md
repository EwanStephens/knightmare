# Knightmare - LLM Agent Summary

## Project Overview
Knightmare is a word-building puzzle game that combines chess mechanics with word creation. The game is built using Next.js 15.3, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Wordbank Management
- Wordbanks are JSON files in `src/data/wordbanks/`, generated by filtering large English word lists to remove short, plural, or invalid words.
- Each wordbank contains `unused_words` and `used_words` arrays to ensure no repeats.
- Words are moved between these lists as puzzles are generated or failed (if the word was from the wordbank).
- Filtering and merging scripts log all changes and reasons for exclusion.

## Puzzle Generation Pipeline
- Puzzles can be generated in two ways:
  1. **By word length:** A random unused word of the specified length is picked from the wordbank.
  2. **By explicit target word:** Any word can be specified directly (not affecting the wordbank).
- The board is generated to allow a unique path for the target word, with extra random letters added.
- Validation ensures the target word is the uniquely longest solution and has a unique solution path.
- If board generation or validation fails, the word is returned to the unused list (if it was from the wordbank), and the failed board is saved to `src/interesting/` for review.

## Puzzle Output & ID System
- Puzzles are saved to `src/puzzles/<wordLength>_letter/puzzle_<wordLength>-<extraLetters>-<nanoid>.json`.
- Each puzzle has a unique 7-character nanoID as part of its filename.
- Utility functions in `puzzleUtils.ts` handle ID generation, collision checking, and path resolution for programmatic use.

## Modular Structure
- `wordbankManager.ts`: Wordbank loading, selection, and updating.
- `boardGenerator.ts`: Board and path generation.
- `validator.ts`: Board validation and longest word search.
- `serializer.ts`: Puzzle serialization to JSON.
- `puzzleUtils.ts`: Puzzle ID and path utilities.

## Error Handling & Logging
- Failed boards are saved to `src/interesting/` with details for review.
- All wordbank changes and filtering steps are logged for transparency.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Board
- 5x5 chess board
- Each occupied square contains:
  1. A chess piece (either white or black)
  2. A letter in the top-right corner

### Move Rules
1. Players must make legal chess moves according to standard chess rules
2. Only capturing moves are allowed
3. Only pieces of the opposite color can be captured
4. Moves must be made in sequence to build valid English words
5. Words must match the target word for the level

### Special Rules
- Pawns:
  - Can only capture diagonally
  - White pawns move upward
  - Black pawns move downward

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
1. Board Component (`ChessBoard.tsx`)
   - Renders the 5x5 chess board
   - Handles piece selection and move validation
   - Manages visual state (highlighting)
   - Implements responsive design for various screen sizes

2. Game State Management
   - Tracks current word being built
   - Maintains move history
   - Validates moves against chess rules
   - Validates completed words against target word

3. Visual Feedback System
   - Blue (#94A3B8): Selected pieces
   - Green corner indicators: Legal moves
   - Yellow: Previous moves in current word
   - Red flash: Illegal moves
   - Yellow pulsing highlight: Tutorial guidance

4. Tutorial System
   - Three progressive tutorial levels with dedicated URLs (/tutorial/1, /tutorial/2, /tutorial/3)
   - JSON-based configuration for each tutorial level
   - Interactive guided experience with contextual popups
   - Positioned tutorial popups (top/bottom of screen)
   - Intelligent step triggering based on piece selection and current word
   - Highlighted UI elements (chess pieces, buttons, etc.)
   - Completion modals between tutorial levels
   - Blurred background effect during level completion
   - Special feedback for tutorial-specific actions like board clearing

### User Interface Elements
- Responsive chess board with square cells
- Word-building display with letter placeholders
- Clear button to reset the current attempt
- Success modal on completion
- Top bar with navigation elements
- Level picker for jumping to specific levels
- Tutorial mode with guided instructions

## Responsive Design Implementation

### Chessboard
- Fully responsive board that adapts to viewport size
- Chess squares using aspect ratio for consistent proportions
- Dynamic sizing with minimum thresholds for small screens
- Viewport-based scaling (vw/vh) with absolute minimums

### Chess Pieces
- SVG chess pieces with proportional scaling
- Responsive letter sizes using min/max/clamp for proper sizing
- Font sizing with viewport units and minimum guaranteed size
- Optimized positioning for all screen sizes

### Answer Display
- Responsive container with dynamic height
- Font sizes that scale with viewport while adjusting for word length
- Minimum threshold sizes to ensure readability
- Balanced spacing that reduces on smaller screens

## Illegal Move Handling
- First piece selection: Ignores clicks on empty squares
- Subsequent moves:
  - Ignores clicks on squares that aren't legal moves
  - Shows specific error message for legal moves that don't capture opposite color
  - Provides visual feedback with a red flash on the invalid square
  - Preserves current word progress when showing errors

## Level System
- Game includes multiple puzzle levels
- Each level has a specific target word to solve
- Board configuration is designed for the target word
- Success modal provides navigation to next level
- Level generator script for creating new challenges

## Tutorial System
- Comprehensive onboarding for new players
- Progressive instruction across three levels accessed via dedicated URLs:
  1. **Level 1 (BOAT)**: Basic movement and captures
  2. **Level 2 (CHECK)**: Advanced concepts with unused pieces
  3. **Level 3 (FINISH)**: Self-guided challenge
- JSON-based tutorial configuration similar to regular levels
- Contextual highlighting system for UI elements:
  - Chess pieces
  - Clear button
  - Target word length display
- Modals that can be positioned at the top or bottom of the screen
- Intelligent step triggering based on both:
  - Selected piece position
  - Current word progress
- Reusable completion modal component with blurred background effect
- Simplified naming convention ("Knightmare Tutorial")
- Step triggers for various player actions:
  - First piece selection
  - Captures
  - Board clearing
  - Special situations (like redundant letters "CC")

## LLM-Specific Guidelines

### Move Validation
When validating moves, check:
1. Is the piece's movement pattern legal according to chess rules?
2. Is it a capturing move?
3. Is the captured piece of the opposite color?
4. Does the move contribute to a valid word sequence?

### Word Building Logic
1. Track letters from each captured piece
2. Concatenate letters in the order of capture
3. Validate against target word
4. Provide appropriate feedback for completion

### State Management Considerations
1. Board state must be updated after each move
2. Previous moves in current word sequence must be tracked
3. Visual feedback must be updated in real-time
4. Invalid moves must trigger appropriate error messages and visual cues
