description: Use this rule when you are asked to create a pull request
globs: 
alwaysApply: false

When asked to create a pull request:
- Use the github MCP tool in preference to the CLI
- Assume that the feature branch has already been created and all code has been pushed
- Check the name of the feature branch and the remote branch if you're not sure what they are before creating the pull request
- Do not be overly focussed on recent changes that are made as part of the PR. Look closely at all the changes made before coming up with a PR description
- Do not include details about things that were changed and then reverted in the PR description. We only care about the differences between the base branch and the current branch
- Print out the proposed title and description of the PR for the user to review before making the tool call
