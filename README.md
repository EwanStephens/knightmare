  - Make only legal chess moves
  - Capture pieces of the opposite color
  - Create valid English words that match the target word
- Pawns can only capture diagonally
  - White pawns move up the board
  - Black pawns move down the board

## Daily Puzzle Calendar

- Each day features three puzzles: short, medium, and long
- Progress is tracked per puzzle; solved puzzles are remembered in your browser
- The daily page automatically redirects to the next unsolved puzzle for today
- See [src/data/calendar/README.md](src/data/calendar/README.md) for calendar details

## Daily Puzzle Generation

See [src/data/calendar/README.md](src/data/calendar/README.md) for how daily puzzles are generated and managed.

## Stats, Streak, and Share Functionality

- **Per-puzzle stats** are tracked in your browser for each puzzle:
  - Whether you solved it
  - How many hints you used
  - Whether you used the reveal
  - How many times you pressed clear
  - How many times you pressed each piece type
- **Global stats** track your overall progress:
  - Days played
  - Current streak (consecutive days with at least one daily puzzle played)
  - Max streak
- **Streak** is shown in the completion modal and in the share text as a minimal flame emoji and number (e.g. "ðŸ”¥7").
- **Share**: After completing the daily puzzles, you can share your results. The share text includes:
  - Date
  - Emoji summary for each puzzle (hints, reveal, solved)
  - Piece usage summary
  - Your current streak (if 2+ days)

## Running the Share/Stats Unit Test

To run the unit test for the share text and stats logic:

```bash
npx ts-node --compiler-options '{"module":"CommonJS"}' src/utils/gameState.test.ts
```

This will print several example share texts and show the expected output format, including the minimal streak format (e.g. "ðŸ”¥7").
